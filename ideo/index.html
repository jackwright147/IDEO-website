  <section id="intro">

    <p class="top_p">Throughout this essay I’m going to be talking about IDEO and how they have helped people learn that being creative isn’t something only few people have the luxury of having. IDEO has been able to help people break down the barrier that stops them from doing something different.</p>
    <p class="bottom_p">They teach you that you shouldn’t feel scared or pressured to not try something new, and that’s what this essay is going to be about, how IDEO helped people become more creative, break out of their shell and not be afraid try things out of their comfort zone.</p>

    <h2>Who Is IDEO?</h2>

    <p class="founded">IDEO dates back to 1978 and was founded by David Kelley with his design firm, David Kelley Design also known as “DKD”. In 1991 Bill Moggridge and Mike Nuttall brought their companies together along with <img class="ideo_logo logo_border" src="images/ideo_logo.png" alt="Logo of IDEO" height="70px"> David’s to create IDEO, IDEO have always focused on human-centred design. This is a key point as to how IDEO help people become more creative. They base all of their workshops and other learning materials around the people in need of them. There is something to learn for everyone, it’s not all based around a certain selection of people. </p>

    <p class="mouse"> In 1980 IDEO used their knowledge of human-centred design to create a mouse for Steve Jobs for a computer called, “The Lisa”. The design was able to make the mouse easily manufacturable by replacing the more expensive components and because of that, more affordable as well. This is a prime example of human-centred design because not only did they make it easy to use, they were also able to drop the price so more people could afford it.  </p>
